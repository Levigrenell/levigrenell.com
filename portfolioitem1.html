    <h3>This is EARTH<br>WORLD!</h3>
    <p>Here, you can...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how to survive.</li>
      <li>Develop new team building skills.</li>
      <li>Enjoy quality food cooked out in the wilderness using ingredients that you, yourself foraged or hunted for yourself.</li>
      <li>Build encampments for yourself and your family all while being able to learn your way up to being completely sustainable.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>So, what is it?</h3>
    <p class="textind">It's not your 'usual' amusement park. It's way more than that! A logo based off of an earthrise, depicted by this photo taken on December 24, 1968 by apollo astronaut William Anders. Emphasizing this idea of the Earth and our place in it. Changing the definition of what amusement in amusement park really means.
      <br> The purpose of this was to design an amusement park where someone could feel free to be themselves and allow them a bit more than just a simple camping experience. People want to learn how to survive in the wilderness and to have fun with it!</li>
      <p class="textind">There was a lot of fun to be had and the ideas that spring from this one idea could go on and on forever. The poster itself skipped back and forth from sketches to photoshop and back again. What would you expect from a place that isn't like your 'usual' amusement park? What is the best way of conveying this? </p>
