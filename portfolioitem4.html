    <h3>Kern.</h3>
    <p>Wherever, Whenever</p>
    
  </p>
  <h3>So, what is it?</h3>
    <p class="textind">Hey, don't get me wrong, I love my car. As Americans if we didn't have our cars we wouldn't have that essential freedom that comes with being able to drive and explore this god-given land we call home.</p>
    <p class="textind">At the same time...</p>
    <p class="textind">Can we just appreciate the absolute beauty of the traditional train system? Sometimes we get so wrapped up in this idea of getting to where <em>we</em> need to get that we forget we could enjoy our commute just a bit more. </p>
    <h3>INTRODUCING Kern </h3>
    <p class="textind">People enjoy this idea of creating a comfortable atmosphere where one has the ability to see greater sights and travel more, but only through the comfortability of their phones. What if instead we could get people <em>there</em> to the places that they see on their phones. International train system. Can you imagine your own little cabin to cozy up in and enjoy some warm hot coco while being whisked through icy tundra-like plains? 
    What about a world where teleportation exists between cities, states, grocery stores, clubs, school, work and then back to that home sweet home?  </p>
    <p class="smalltxt">also as an older gen-z, I might like trains. </p>
